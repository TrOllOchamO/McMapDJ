# McMapDJ
A simple terminal app to manage quickly your minecraft maps on your spigot server

### What's the point of using McMapDJ ?

Running your own vanilla minecraft server is cool, but managing it can be tedious sometimes...  
Especialy when it come to change the map multiple times a day.  
Close the server, make a save, upload the new map, (rename some directories), start the server at the right version and manually download the spigot.jar file if the wanted version is missing...  
Already a pain, but it is even more when your friends keep asking you if you are done while you are doing it.  

It wouldn't be nice if it was possible to set or generate a map quikly ? If the server would automaticaly start at the right version ? Or if the spigot.jar would download automaticaly if needed ?

Well it's exactly what McMapDJ doese !
